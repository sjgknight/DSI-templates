# DSI-templates

Template files for the Assessment Task 2 (AT2) in Data Science for Innovation 36100.

The templates show some basic functions of using markdown and notebooks to combine code, output, and writing. 

For students in the MDSI: Remember, the point of using these templates is to learn to work in a new environment, and start to map out skills to develop. Take the easiest options in most cases, you can create figures in other tools ([rawgraphs.io](http://rawgraphs.io) is great) and include them, use footnotes instead of bibtex, etc. 
The aim of the task is not to do the most technically impressive or beautiful things, it is to demonstrate an understanding of how we can communicate with and about data, and the potential and limitations of data in providing (new) insight into us and our world.

There may be errors, feel free to create issues or pull requests. It'd be great to create a Quarto Qmd version (inc python chunks) at some point.
